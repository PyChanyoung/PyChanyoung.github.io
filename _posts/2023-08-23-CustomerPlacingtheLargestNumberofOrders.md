## SQL Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists orders (order_number int, customer_number int)
Truncate table orders
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('1', '1')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('2', '2')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('3', '3')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('4', '3')
```

Table: `Orders`

```
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
```

## Question

Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed **the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

<**Example 1**>

```
Input:
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output:
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation:
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order.
So the result is customer_number 3.
```

## Solution

```sql
with tmp as (
    select customer_number, count(*) as cnt
    from Orders
    group by customer_number
)
select customer_number
from tmp
order by cnt desc
limit 1
```
